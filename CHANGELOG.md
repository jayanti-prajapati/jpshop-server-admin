* (email-plugin) The default email handlers have been updated to use the new User model, and as a result the email templates "email-verification", "email-address-change" and "password-reset" should be updated to remove the "user" object, so `{{ user.verificationToken }}` becomes `{{ verificationToken }}` and so on.
* (TypeORM): Due to an update of the TypeORM version, there is a potential breaking change if you make use of TypeORM's soft-remove feature in combination with listeners/subscribers. Namely, update listeners and subscriber no longer triggered by soft-remove and recover (https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0242-2022-02-16). This is not used in Vendure core and is a relatively obscure edge-case.
* `adjustmentOperations` query has been replaced by `promotionConditions` and `promotionActions`

* ConfigurableOperations (ShippingEligibilityChecker, ShippingCalculator, CollectionFilter, PromotionCondition, PromotionAction, PaymentMethodHandler) have a new API for defining their arguments. For existing Vendure installations, any Shipping Methods, Promotions and Collection will need to be re-configured after the update by removing any checker/calculator/filter/condition/action and re-adding it.
* `Order.taxSummary` now includes shipping taxes
* `Promotion` & `PaymentMethod` `description` is once again non-nullable. This will
require a simple non-destructive DB migration.
* A change to the relation between OrderItems and Fulfillments means a database
migration will be required to preserve fulfillment data of existing Orders.
See the release blog post for details.
* A database migration is required for the new Asset tags support.
* A DB migration will be required due to some additions to the schema related to Customer history entries.
* A minor breaking change has been made to the GraphQL API: The `Order.discounts` and
`OrderLine.discounts` fields now return `amount` and `amountWithTax`. Previously they only had
`amount`, which was actually the tax-inclusive value. So if you want to show discount amounts with
tax, use `amountWithTax` and otherwise use `amount`.
* A new "slug" field has been added to the CollectionTranslation entity, requiring a DB migration. Also, when creating a new Collection via the `createCollection` mutation, each translation must include a slug.
* A new `AuthenticationMethod` entity has been added, with a one-to-many relation to the existing User entities. Several properties that were formerly part of the User entity have now moved to the `AuthenticationMethod` entity. Upgrading with therefore require a careful database migration to ensure that no data is lost. On release, a migration script will be provided for this.
* A new `couponCodes` column is added to the Order table, which will require a DB migration.
* A new `promotions` relation has been added to the order table, and a `perCustomerUsageLimit` column to the promotion table. This will require a DB migration.
* A new `Region` entity has been introduced, which is a base class for `Country` and
the new `Province` entity. The `Zone.members` property is now an array of `Region` rather than
`Country`, since Zones may now be composed of both countries and provinces. If you have defined
any custom fields on `Country`, you'll need to change it to `Region` in your custom fields config.
* A new field, `focalPoint` has been added to the `Asset` entity which will require a database migration to add.
* A new JobRecord entity has been added, so a DB migration will be needed.
* All `languageCode` GraphQL arguments have been removed from queries and instead, a "languageCode" query param may be attached to the API URL to specify the language of any translatable entities.
* All Vendure packages are now built on TypeScript v4.0.3. With new TypeScript versions come the possibility that its improved type-checking abilities will uncover new errors that it had not detected previously.
* ChannelService.findAll() will now returns a PaginatedList<Channel> instead of a Channel[]
* ConfigurableOperations descriptions must now be specified as an array of LocalizedString rather than just a plain string. This allows the descriptions to be adapted to other locales.
* Deletions of Orders or Customers now cascade to any associated HistoryEntries,
thus preserving referential integrity. This involves a DB schema change which will necessitate
a migration.
* Explicit indexes have been added to many-to-one relations used throughout the data
model. If you are using MySQL/MariaDB you should not notice a change from this, since they
automatically add indexes to FK relations. Postgres, however, does not so this change will require
a DB migration.
* Fulfillments now start in the new "Created" state, and then _immediately_
transition to the "Pending" state. This allows e.g. event listeners to pick up newly-created
Fulfillments.
* If you are using the `.loadData()` method of an EmailEventHandler, the callback signature has changed to provide an instance of the Injector class, rather than an `inject()` function.
* If you are using the s3 storage strategy of the AssetServerPlugin, it has been updated to use v3 of the AWS SDKs. This update introduces [an improved modular architecture to the AWS sdk](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/), resulting in smaller bundle sizes. You need to install the `@aws-sdk/client-s3` & `@aws-sdk/lib-storage` packages, and can remove the `aws-sdk` package.
* If you use custom field controls in the Admin UI, you'll need to slightly modify the component class: the `customFieldConfig` property has been renamed to `config` and a required `readonly: boolean;` field should be added. This is part of an effort to unify the way custom input components work across different parts of the Admin UI.
* In order to accommodate Asset deletion, some non-destructive DB modifications have been made which will require a migration.
* In order to support order modification, a couple of new default order states
have been created - `Modifying` and `ArrangingAdditionalPayment`. Also a new DB entity,
`OrderModification` has been created.
* In the Admin UI, the "stock locations" list and detail views
have been moved from the "catalog" module to the "settings" module. Also, the
menu item & breadcrumb for "inventory" has been renamed to "products".

This is an end-user breaking change rather than a code breaking change. Any UI
extensions that link to a `/catalog/inventory/...` route will still work as there
is a redirect in place to `/catalog/products/...`.
* Indexes have been added to the ProductTranslation & CollectionTranslation slug
fields. This means a database migration will be needed - the change is small and non-destructive
so this is a routine migration which should not require manual editing of the migration script.
* MolliePlugin - A new mollieOrderId has been added in order to prevent duplicate payments in Mollie. This will require a DB migration to add the custom field to your DB schema.
* Nestjs has been updated to v7. If you make use of any of the Nest internals in your plugins, this may cause some breaking changes. Please see the [Nest migration guide](https://docs.nestjs.com/migration-guide) for details.

  This release also includes updates to many dependencies which in turn have dropped support for Node.js v8. Therefore **Vendure now supports Node.js v10** or higher.
* Nestjs has been updated to v7. If you make use of any of the Nest internals in your plugins, this may cause some breaking changes. Please see the [Nest migration guide](https://docs.nestjs.com/migration-guide) for details.

* New DB relation Asset to Channel, requiring a migration. The Admin API mutations `deleteAsset` and `deleteAssets` have changed their argument signature.
* Options in the VendureConfig related to the API have been moved into a new location: `VendureConfig.apiOptions`. The affected options are `hostname`, `port`, `adminApiPath`, `shopApiPath`, `channelTokenKey`, `cors`, `middleware` and `apolloServerPlugins`.

```TypeScript
// before
const config: VendureConfig = {
  port: 3000,
  middleware: [/*...*/],
  // ...
}

// after
const config: VendureConfig = {
  apiOptions: {
      port: 3000,
      middleware: [/*...*/],
  },
  // ...
}
```

This also applies to the `ConfigService`, in case you are using it in a custom plugin.
* Orders are now channel-aware which requires a non-destructive DB migration to apply the schema changes required for this relation.
* Orders now start in the new "Created" state, and then _immediately_ transition
to the "AddingItems" state. This allows e.g. event listeners to pick up newly-created Orders.
* Removes `atLeastNOfProduct` from defaultPromotionConditions and `itemPercentageDiscount` & `buy1Get1Free` from defaultPromotionActions. They are either not useful or need to be re-implemented in a way that works correctly.
* Some ON DELETE behaviour was incorrectly defined in the database schema, and has how been fixed. This will require a non-destructive migration.
* The "facetIds" field of the SearchInput type has been renamed to "facetValueIds" to better reflect the expected id type.
* The `'facetValueIds'` type has been removed from the `ConfigArgType` type, and replaced by `'ID'` and the `list` option. This change only affects you if you have created custom CollectionFilters of PromotionActions/Conditions using the `'facetValueIds'` type for an argument.
* The `@vendure/testing` package now requires you to explicitly register initializers for the databases you with to test against. This change enables e2e tests to be run against any database supported by TypeORM. The `dataDir` option has been removed from the call to the `TestServer.init()` method, as it is specific to the SqljsInitializer:

before:
```TypeScript
import { createTestEnvironment, testConfig } from '@vendure/testing';

describe('my e2e test suite', () => {
    const { server, adminClient } = createTestEnvironment(testConfig);

    beforeAll(() => {
        await server.init({
            dataDir: path.join(__dirname, '__data__'),
            initialData,
            productsCsvPath: path.join(__dirname, 'fixtures/e2e-products-minimal.csv'),
            customerCount: 1,
        });
    });

    //...
});
```

after:
```TypeScript
import { createTestEnvironment, registerInitializer, SqljsInitializer, testConfig } from '@vendure/testing';

registerInitializer('sqljs', new SqljsInitializer(path.join(__dirname, '__data__')));

describe('my e2e test suite', () => {
    const { server, adminClient } = createTestEnvironment(testConfig);

    beforeAll(() => {
        await server.init({
            initialData,
            productsCsvPath: path.join(__dirname, 'fixtures/e2e-products-minimal.csv'),
            customerCount: 1,
        });
    });

    //...
});
```
* The `AttemptedLoginEvent.identifier` property is now optional, since it will only be sent when using the "native" authentication strategy. Code that listens for this event should now check that the `identifier` property is defined before attempting to use it.
* The `AuthenticationStrategy.onLogOut()` function
signature has changed: the first argument is now the RequestContext of the current request.
* The `CatalogModificationEvent` which was previously published whenever changes were made to `Product` or `ProductVariant` entities has been replaced with a `ProductEvent` and `ProductVariantEvent`, including the type of event ('created', 'updated', 'deleted').
* The `Channel.currencyCode` field has been renamed to `defaultCurrencyCode`, and a
new `currencyCode` field has been added to the `ProductVariantPrice` entity. This will require
a database migration with care taken to preserve exiting data.
* The `channels` mutation now returns a PaginatedList rather than
a simple array of Channels.
* The `customer` and `user` tables have received some non-destructive modifications, requiring a DB migration.
* The `generateVariantsForProduct` mutation has been removed
* The `ID` type in `@vendure/common/lib/generated-types` & `@vendure/common/lib/generated-shop-types` is now correctly typed as `string | number`, whereas previously it was `string`. If you are using any generated types in your plugin code, this may lead to TypeScript compiler errors which will need to be corrected.
* The `languageCode` argument has been removed from all Shop API queries, namely `product`, `products`, `collection` and `collections`. Instead, LanguageCode should be specified as a query param.
* The `LocalAssetStorageStrategy` class has been removed from `@vendure/core` and now lives in the `@vendure/asset-server-plugin` package.
* The `Order` entity now has a new column, `taxZoneId`. This is used to more efficiently track changes to the active tax zone, and therefore reduce the number of tax calculations to be performed on an Order. This change will require a migration which should be routine.
* The `OrderItem.taxRate` column type in the database has been changed from `int` to `decimal`. You will need to perform a migration to update this column and depending on your database type, you may need to manually edit the migration script in order to preserve the old values.
* The `OrderItem.unitPrice` is now _always_ given as the net (without tax) price
of the related ProductVariant. Formerly, it was either the net or gross price, depending on
the `pricesIncludeTax` setting of the Channel. If you have existing Orders where
`unitPriceIncludesTax = true`, you will need to manually update the `unitPrice` value *before*
running any other migrations for this release. The query will look like:

    `UPDATE order_item SET unitPrice = ROUND(unitPrice / ((taxRate + 100) / 100)) WHERE unitPriceIncludesTax = 1`
* The `OrderLine.pendingAdjustments` field has been renamed to `adjustments`, tax
adjustments are now stored in a new field, `taxLines`. This will require a DB migration to
preserve data from existing Orders (see guide in release blog post)
* The `OrderLine.totalPrice` field has been deprecated and will be removed in a
future release. Use the new `OrderLine.linePriceWithTax` field instead.
* The `orderOptions.generateOrderCode` config option has been replaced with `orderOptions.orderCodeStrategy`. This change allows order code generation to take advantage of the `InjectableStrategy` interface, i.e. to be able to inject Vendure services and other providers (e.g. the database connection). See the `OrderCodeStrategy` documentation for guidance on how to use the new API.
* The `Payment.metadata` field is not private by default, meaning that it can only be read via the Admin API. Data required in the Shop API can be accessed by putting it in a field named `public`. Example: `Payment.metadata.public.redirectUrl`
* The `PaymentMethodHandler.createPayment()` method now takes a new `amount`
argument. Update any custom PaymentMethodHandlers to use account for this new parameter and use
it instead of `order.total` when creating a new payment.

    ```ts
    // before
    createPayment: async (ctx, order, args, metadata) {
      const transactionAmount = order.total;
      // ...
    }

    // after
    createPayment: async (ctx, order, amount, args, metadata) {
      const transactionAmount = amount;
      // ...
    }
    ```
* The `PaymentMethodHandler` function signatures have changed:
`createPayment()`, `settlePayment()` & `createRefund()` now all get passed the
RequestContext object as the first argument.
* The `PriceCalculationStrategy.calculateUnitPrice()` function
signature has changed: the first argument is now the RequestContext of the current request.
* The `ProductVariant.trackInventory` field is now an Enum rather than a boolean, allowing explicit inheritance of the value set in GlobalSettings. This will require a DB migration with a custom query to transform the previous boolean values to the new enum (string) values of "TRUE", "FALSE" or "INHERIT". Check the release blog post for more details.
* The `reindex` mutation now returns a JobInfo type, which has an id that can then be polled via the new `job` query as to its progress and status.
* The `RequestContext.session` object is no longer a `Session` entity. Instead it is a new type, `SerializedSession` which contains a subset of data pertaining to the current session. For example, if you have custom code which references `ctx.session.activeOrder` you will now get an error, since `activeOrder` does not exist on `SerializedSession`. Instead you would use `SerializedSession.activeOrderId` and then lookup the order in a separate query.

The reason for this change is to enable efficient session caching.
* The `search` query's `SearchResult` type has had two properties deprecated: `productPreview` and `productVariantPreview`. They are replaced by `productAsset.preview` and `productVariantAsset.preview respectively`. The deprecated properties still work but will be removed from a future release.
* The `SearchIndexItem` entity used by the `DefaultSearchPlugin` has a couple of new fields related to Channel handling. Once the schema is updated (either by synchronizing or running a migration), the search index should be rebuilt.
* The `ShippingMethod` entity is now translatable. This change will require a DB
migration to be performed, including custom queries to migrate any existing ShippingMethods
to the new table structure (see release blog post for details).
* The `TaxCalculationStrategy` has been renamed to
`ProductVariantPriceCalculationStrategy` and moved in the VendureCofig from `taxOptions` to
`catalogOptions` and its API has been simplified.
The `PriceCalculationStrategy` has been renamed to `OrderItemPriceCalculationStrategy`.
* The `taxCategories` mutation now returns a PaginatedList rather than
a simple array of TaxCategory objects.
* The `TaxRate.value` column type in the database has been changed from `int` to `decimal`. You will need to perform a migration to update this column and depending on your database type, you may need to manually edit the migration script in order to preserve the old values.
* The `zones` query now returns a PaginatedList rather than a simple array of
`Zone` objects. Likewise, the `ZoneService.findAll()` method also returns a paginated list.
The old behaviour of `ZoneService.findAll()` (all Zones, cached for rapid access) can now be
found under the new `ZoneService.getAllWithMembers()` method.
* The Admin UI component `vdr-product-selector` has been renamed to
 `vdr-product-variant-selector` to more accurately represent what it does.

 If you are using `vdr-product-selector` if any ui extensions code, update it to use the
 new selector.
* The Administrator entity has a new `deletedAt` field, which will require a non-destructive database migration.
* The API for configuring Admin UI extensions has changed to allow a single extension to define multiple Angular NgModules. This arose as a requirement when working on more complex UI extensions which e.g. define both a shared and a lazy module which share code. Such an arrangement was not possible using the existing API.

Here's how to update:
```TypeScript
// Old API
extensions: [
    {
        type: 'lazy',
        ngModulePath: path.join(__dirname, 'ui-extensions/greeter'),
        ngModuleFileName: 'greeter-extension.module.ts',
        ngModuleName: 'GreeterModule',
    }
],

// New API
extensions: [
    {
        extensionPath: path.join(__dirname, 'ui-extensions/greeter'),
        ngModules: [{
            type: 'lazy',
            ngModuleFileName: 'greeter-extension.module.ts',
            ngModuleName: 'GreeterModule',
        }],
    }
],
```
* The AssetNamingStrategy `generateSourceFileName()` & `generatePreviewFileName()`
function signatures have changed: the first argument is now the
RequestContext of the current request.
* The AssetPreviewStrategy `generatePreviewImage()`
function signature has changed: the first argument is now the
RequestContext of the current request.
* The AssetServerPlugin has a new default naming strategy - instead of dumping all assets & previews into a single directory, it will now split sources & previews into subdirectories and in each of them will use hashed directories to ensure that the total number of files in a single directory does not grow too large (as this can have a negative performance impact). If you wish to keep the current behavior, then you must manually set the `namingStrategy: new DefaultAssetNamingStrategy()` in the `AssetServerPlugin.init()` method.
* The CollectionAsset entity had a cascade delete defined, which will require a DB migration.
* The data structure used to represent the tree of Collections has changed,
which will require a DB migration.
* The default `dbConnectionOptions.timezone` setting is now set to `'Z'` (UTC). If you have not explicitly set the timezone in your project, then up until now it would have defaulted to `'local'`. To preserve this behavior you can override this new default by setting `dbConnectionOptions.timezone: 'local'` in your VendureConfig.
* The Facet and FacetValue entities are now channel-aware. This change to the
schema will require a DB migration.
* The Fulfillment and ShippingMethod entities have new fields relating to
FulfillmentHandlers. This will require a DB migration, though no custom data migration will be
needed for this particular change.

The `addFulfillmentToOrder` mutation input has changed: the `method` & `trackingCode` fields
have been replaced by a `handler` field which accepts a FulfillmentHandler code, and any
expected arguments defined by that handler.
* The graphql-playground for the Shop and Admin APIs are now turned off by default, and the Apollo server debug option is also set to false by default (it was formerly true). You can manually configure these values using the VendureConfig.apiOptions object.

* The internal ErrorResult classes now take all constructors arguments
as a single input object.
* The internal ErrorResult classes now take all constructors arguments
as a single input object.

feat(core): Update codegen errors plugin to use object inputs
* The internal handling of stock movements has been refined,
which required changes to the DB schema. This will require a migration.
* The internal representation of Asset relations has changed to enable explicit ordering of assets. This change means that the database schema had to be updated.
* The introduction of the new MoneyStrategy includes a new GraphQL `Money` scalar,
which replaces `Int` used in v1.x. In practice, this is still a `number` type and should not
break any client applications. One point to note is that `Money` is based on the `Float` scalar
and therefore can represent decimal values, allowing fractions of cents to be represented.
* The JobQueueService has been completely re-designed. In the unlikely event that you are using this service in your Plugins, please see the API documentation on how to use it now.
* The minimum Redis recommended version is 6.2.0
* The new `inheritFilters` property on the Collection entity will require a DB
migration.
* The OrderItem entity has a new field, `initialListPrice`, used to better
handle price changes to items in an active Order. This schema change will require a DB migration.
* The OrderMergeStrategy `merge()`
function signature has changed: the first argument is now the
RequestContext of the current request.
* The PaymentMethod entity and type has changed. Previously, a PaymentMethod was
coupled to the configured PaymentMethodHandlers 1-to-1. Now the PaymentMethodHandler is just
a configurable _property_ of the PaymentMethod, much in the same way that a ShippingCalculator
relates to a ShippingMethod. Any existing PaymentMethod entities will need to be migrated to the
new structure.
* The PaymentMethod entity is now channel-aware which will require a DB migration
to migrate existing PaymentMethods
* The ProductOptionGroup & ProductOption entities have a new `deletedAt` column
which will require a DB migration.
* The ProductTranslation entity has had a constraint removed, requiring a schema
migration.
* The Promotion entity is now translatable, which means existing promotions will need
to be migrated to the new DB schema and care taken to preserve the name data. Also the GraphQL
API for creating and updating Promotions, as well as the corresponding PromotionService methods
have changed to take a `translations` array for setting the `name` and `description` in a given
language.
* The PromotionAction `execute()`
function signature has changed: the first argument is now the
RequestContext of the current request.
* The return object of the ShippingCalculator class has changed:
    ```ts
    // before
    return {
      price: 500,
      priceWithTax: 600,
    };

    // after
    return {
      price: 500,
      taxRate: 20,
      priceIncludesTax: false,
    };
    ```
    This change will require you to update any custom ShippingCalculator implementations, and also
    to update any ShippingMethods by removing and re-selecting the ShippingCalculator.
* The ShippingCalculator `calculate()`
function signature has changed: the first argument is now the
RequestContext of the current request.
* The ShippingEligibilityChecker `check()`
function signature has changed: the first argument is now the
RequestContext of the current request.
* The Shop API mutations `setOrderShippingAddress`, `setOrderBillingAddress`
`setOrderCustomFields` now return a union type which includes a new `NoActiveOrderError`.
Code which refers to these mutations will need to be updated to account for the union
with the fragment spread syntax `...on Order {...}`.
* The signature of the `OrderMergeStrategy.merge()` method has changed. If you have
implemented a custom OrderMergeStrategy, you'll need to update it to return the expected type.
* The Stripe plugin has been made channel aware. This means your api key and webhook secret are now stored in the database, per channel, instead of environment variables.

To migrate to v2 of the Stripe plugin from @vendure/payments you need to:

Remove the apiKey and webhookSigningSecret from the plugin initialization in vendure-config.ts:
```diff
-StripePlugin.init({
-    apiKey: process.env.YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,
-    webhookSigningSecret: process.env.YOUR_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET,
-    storeCustomersInStripe: true,
-}),
+StripePlugin.init({
+    storeCustomersInStripe: true,
+ }),
```
Start the server and login as administrator.

For each channel that you'd like to use Stripe payments, you need to create a payment method with payment handler Stripe payment and the apiKey and webhookSigningSecret belonging to that channel's Stripe account.
* The TaxCalculationStrategy return value has been simplified - it now only need
return the `price` and `priceIncludesTax` properties. The `ProductVariant` entity has also been
refactored to bring it into line with the corrected tax handling of the OrderItem entity. This
will require a DB migration. See release blog post for details.
* The TaxCategory entity now has an `isDefault` property, requiring a DB migration.
* The TaxZoneStrategy `determineTaxZone()`
function signature has changed: the first argument is now the
RequestContext of the current request.
* The TypeORM `Connection` should no longer be directly used. Instead, inject the new `TransactionalConnection` class, which wraps the TypeORM connection and enables database transactions to be used in conjunction with the new `@Transaction` decorator.

The `getEntityOrThrow()` and `findOneInChannel()` helper functions have been deprecated and replaced by methods with the same name (but slightly different signature) on the TransactionalConnection class.
* The update of Apollo Server to v4 includes some breaking changes if you have
defined any custom ApolloServerPlugins. See the Apollo migration guide for full details:
https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration/
* The upgrade of the Admin UI to Angular v10 means that if you are using the `@vendure/ui-devkit` package to compile an extended version of the Admin UI, you need to have at least TypeScript v3.9.2 installed.
* The way custom Order states are defined has changed. The `VendureConfig.orderOptions.process` property now accepts an **array** of objects implementing the `CustomerOrderProcess` interface. This interface is more-or-less the same as the old `OrderProcessOptions` object, but the use of an array now allows better composition, and since `CustomerOrderProcess` inherits from `InjectableStrategy`, this means providers can now be injected and used in the custom order process logic.
* The way shipping charges on Orders are represented has been changed - an Order
now contains multiple ShippingLine entities, each of which has a reference to a ShippingMethod.
This will require a database migration with manual queries to preserve existing order data. See
release blog post for details.
* There have been some major changes to the way that Order taxes and discounts are
* This change allows custom fields to be defined on the OrderLine entity. When they are, then the "addItemToOrder" mutation will accept a third argument - "customFields", which matches the fields specified in the config. Additionally, a couple of mutations have been renamed: "removeItemFromOrder" -> "removeOrderLine", "adjustItemQuantity" -> "adjustOrderLine" and their "orderItemId" argument has been renamed to "orderLineId".
* This relates to Admin UI extensions. The `onClick` function signature of any custom ActionBarItems has changed - the second parameter used to be the `ActivatedRoute` - it is now an object containing `ActivatedRoute` plus an instance of `DataService` and `NotificationService`.
* This release introduces a re-architected solution for handling extensions to the Admin UI. *If you do not use the ui extensions feature, you will not need to change anything*. For those already using ui extensions, these are the changes:

* The `@vendure/admin-ui-plugin` now contains only the default admin ui app.
* To create extensions, you will need to install `@vendure/ui-devkit`, which exposes a `compileUiExtensions()` function.
* Here is an example of how the config differs:
  ```ts
    // before
    AdminUiPlugin.init({
        port: 3002,
        extensions: [
            ReviewsPlugin.uiExtensions,
            RewardsPlugin.uiExtensions,
        ],
        watch: true,
    }),
  ```
  ```ts
    // after
  import { compileUiExtensions } from '@vendure/ui-devkit/compiler';

  // ...

    AdminUiPlugin.init({
        port: 3002,
        app: compileUiExtensions({
            // The source files of the admin ui, extended with your extensions,
            // will be output and compiled from this location
            outputPath: path.join(__dirname, '../admin-ui'),
            extensions: [
                ReviewsPlugin.uiExtensions,
                RewardsPlugin.uiExtensions,
            ],
            watch: true,
        }),
    }),
  ```
* For lazy-loaded extension modules, you must now specify a `route` property. This allows us to lazy-load each extension individually, whereas previously _all_ extensions were bundled into a single lazy-loaded chunk.
  ```diff
  export class ReviewsPlugin {
      static uiExtensions: AdminUiExtension = {
          extensionPath: path.join(__dirname, 'ui'),
          id: 'reviews-plugin',
          ngModules: [{
              type: 'lazy',
  +           route: 'product-reviews',
              ngModuleFileName: 'reviews-ui-lazy.module.ts',
              ngModuleName: 'ReviewsUiLazyModule',
          }],
      };
  }

  // in the route config of the lazy-loaded module
  {
  -   path: 'product-reviews',
  +   path: '',
  +   pathMatch: 'full',
      component: AllProductReviewsListComponent,
  },
  ```
* The `CustomFieldControl` interface changed slightly:
  ```diff
  import {
  - CustomFieldConfig,
  + CustomFieldConfigType,
    CustomFieldControl,
  } from '@vendure/admin-ui/core';

  @Component({
      // ...
  })
  export class ReviewCountComponent implements CustomFieldControl  {
  -   customFieldConfig: CustomFieldConfig;
  +   customFieldConfig: CustomFieldConfigType;
      formControl: FormControl;
      // ...
  }
  ```
* Vendure plugins are now defined as Nestjs modules. For
existing installations, the VendureConfig will need to be modified so
that plugins are not instantiated, but use the static .init() method to
pass options to the plugin, e.g.:

    ```
    // before
    plugins: [ new AdminUiPlugin({ port: 3002 }) ],

    // after
    plugins: [ AdminUiPlugin.init({ port: 3002 }) ],
    ```
